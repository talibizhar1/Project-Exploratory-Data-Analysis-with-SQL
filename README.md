# Project: Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL
## Introduction
This project is part of the course SQL: A Practical Introduction for Querying Databases. Here is the source. I will be answering the questions asked on MySQL. I have mentioned the first taks here.
### *Scenario*
 *Imagine you have been hired by a non-profit organization that strives to improve socio-economic conditions and educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. Your job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data.*

You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a real world data professional would. 
### Task I: Load the datasets in database tables
* I downloaded the datasets available in ‘.sql ‘ format and imported all the tables one by one in MySQL database ‘practicedb’ .
